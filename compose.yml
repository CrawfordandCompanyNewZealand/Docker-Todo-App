# This Compose file provides the development environment for the todo app.
# 
# Seeing the final version of the application bundles the frontend with the
# backend, we are able to "simulate" that by using a proxy to route requests
# to the appropriate service. All requests to /api will be routed to the 
# backend while all other requests will be sent to the client service. While
# there is some overlap in the routing rules, the proxy determines the service
# based on the most specific rule.
#
# To view configurations of Traefik, or MySQL database, or phpMyAdmin,
# check corresponding folders in this repository.
